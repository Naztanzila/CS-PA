   Customer_Segmentation_and_Product_Analysis.ipynb: Main notebook containing the analysis code.

Data:
   dataset.csv: CSV file containing the dataset used for analysis.

Tools Used
Python (libraries including pandas, scikit-learn)
Google Colab (for notebook execution and development)

Instructions to Run Locally

Setting Up Environment

Clone the Repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Naztanzila/CS-PA.git
    cd Customer-Segmentation-and-Product-Analysis

Install Dependencies:
  Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.x).
  
Install required libraries using pip:
  pip install pandas scikit-learn

Open the Notebook:
  Navigate to the project directory and launch Jupyter Notebook
  Open Customer_Segmentation_and_Product_Analysis.ipynb in your browser.
  Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to perform data analysis, clustering, and predictive modeling.
  Review outputs and visualizations generated to understand customer segments, product performance, and recommendations.

Additional Information
  Data Source: The dataset (dataset.csv) contains synthetic data generated for demonstration purposes.
  Note: Adjustments may be needed if running outside of Google Colab, such as setting up local data paths.
